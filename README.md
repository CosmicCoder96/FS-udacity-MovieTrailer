This repo is for the **Move Trailer Website** of Udacity Full Stack Developer Nano Degree.

## How To Run
There are no additional dependencies required to run this code. Python 3 has been used for development.

```bash
python3 entertainment_center.py
```


This executes the `entertainment_center.py` file which fetches the movies from the API and triggers the generation of output file `fresh_tomatoes.html`.
The scripts will automatically open the output file in the default web browser, however the output can be accessed at anypoint later by opening `fresh_tomatoes.html`
